## What changes

<!-- One or two sentences. -->

## Checks

- [ ] `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run check` and `npm run example` pass, and the files under `examples/output` are the ones `npm run example` wrote
- [ ] A change to a rule is described in docs/method.md, says what it can and cannot see, and has a test with the manifest, the Xcode project or the Package.resolved written inline and a near miss on each side
- [ ] A change to what the tool cannot see is in docs/limits.md
- [ ] A change to a key of the configuration, or to a form of a manifest, an Xcode project or a Package.resolved that is read, is in docs/inputs.md and in the README
- [ ] A change to a point of a public page is in src/data.js, research/sources.md and docs/rules-and-sources.md, in this project's own words, with no long quotation
- [ ] Nothing in the change, the README or the output reads as a package resolution, a build or a lookup of the latest version; the tool reads the files on disk as text and fetches nothing
- [ ] The readers still refuse what they do not read (a property list or a Package.resolved they do not take, a version that is not a semantic version), with its place, rather than guess
- [ ] No pattern is built from a file or the configuration, and every reader keeps a list of its own, with no recursion, and limits of size, depth and values
- [ ] Text from the input goes through `safeText` before it reaches the output or an error message, the GitHub format escapes what a workflow command gives a meaning to, and the CSV format neutralizes a leading formula character
- [ ] The tool still reads no clock and no locale, opens no network connection, runs nothing it reads, evaluates nothing and writes nothing to disk
- [ ] Work stays bounded: the limits of docs/limits.md hold, and a hostile test has a time check that widens under coverage through `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`
- [ ] A test that depends on the operating system (a link, a device, file permissions) is guarded with `process.platform`, asserts no line of its own, and builds its paths with `resolve()` from forward-slash names
- [ ] No real company, app, package or person in fixtures or examples, hosts only on the reserved `.test` domain, and no number that reads like a year
