# Secure defaults

The default run is the safe run. Nothing in the first section needs a flag, and none of it can be switched off. The rest
of the document is about what the tool cannot do for you: which files you give it, where the output goes, and who may
change the configuration. A clean result is not a package resolution and not a build; it is a project with none of the
problems the rules look for, not a finding that its dependencies are safe or up to date.

## How the tool behaves by default

- **Reads, never fetches.** The tool reads the manifests, the Xcode project files and the Package.resolved files of the
  project folder and the configuration it is given. It follows no symbolic link, fetches no URL, refuses an argument
  that looks like an address, runs no Swift and no Xcode, evaluates nothing, starts no program and writes nothing to
  disk. It never looks up a version.
- **Every rule on from the first run.** A branch requirement, a URL that is not https, one package with two
  requirements, a declared package that Package.resolved does not pin and a pin outside its requirement are errors; a
  bare revision, remote dependencies with no Package.resolved, a stale pin, a range past the next major version, a
  listed deprecated package and a declaration the reader cannot read are warnings; a local package is a note.
- **Fail closed on what it cannot read.** A file that cannot be read and input past the limits of a run are error
  findings that fail the run at the default `failOn` of `error`; these two rules have no key and cannot be lowered or
  set off. A project that cannot be used and an exclude pattern that is not valid stop the run with exit code `2` and
  no result.
- **Unknown keys are errors.** A key in the configuration that the tool does not know stops the run, with its line and
  a suggestion, so a typo such as `failOm` cannot leave a default in place. A key named twice stops the run.
- **No regular expression from the input.** No pattern is built from a file or the configuration.
- **No recursion.** The listing of the project and the readers keep lists of their own, so a deep file cannot exhaust
  the stack.
- **No prototype tricks.** Names from the input are kept in Map objects and looked up in maps and sets or with
  `Object.hasOwn`, and the JSON reader defines own properties, so `__proto__` is only a name.
- **Clean output.** Text from the input, file names included, has control characters, line separators and direction
  controls removed and its length capped before it reaches a report or an error message. The GitHub format escapes
  `%`, CR and LF in a message and also `:` and `,` in a property. The CSV format puts a single quote in front of a field
  that a spreadsheet could read as a formula.
- **The same input gives the same output.** No clock, no zone, no locale and no random number
  ([decision 1](decisions/0001-read-no-clock-and-keep-dates-out-of-the-repository.md)).
- **No dependencies.** Node 22 or newer and nothing else.

## Settings that make the check stricter

- **`"failOn": "warning"`.** Bare revisions, a missing Package.resolved, stale pins, wide ranges and deprecated
  packages fail the run too.
- **`deprecatedPackages`.** List the packages your team has moved away from, and the organizations whose repositories
  moved, with what to use instead.
- **Keep `indirectPins` short.** List a pin only after you have checked which dependency brings it in.
- **Keep `exclude` short.** Leave out only folders that are not part of the app, and review a new pattern like a change
  to code.

## Running it in a pipeline

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
  - uses: actions/setup-node@820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020 # v7.0.0
    with:
      node-version: 22
  - name: Swift package dependency check
    run: npx --yes github:INNERLUXES/spm-dependency-check . --format github
```

- Give the job read access to the contents and nothing more. The tool needs no secret, no Xcode and no macOS runner.
- Pin every action to a full commit, as above, and pin the tool to a release commit or a tag you have read, because
  `npx` runs what it downloads.
- Do not hide the exit code with a trailing `|| true`. To see the report without failing, keep `failOn` at `error` and
  keep the JSON or CSV report as an artifact of the job.
- Treat a CSV report built from files you do not trust as untrusted data: open it with formulas off.
- Run the check before the Xcode build, so a pin outside its requirement is reported with its line before a build
  resolves the packages again.

## Protecting the configuration

The configuration decides which rules report, which packages are deprecated, which pins are accepted without a
declaration, which paths are left out and what fails the run. Keep it in the repository, put its path in `CODEOWNERS`
with the people who own the app, and require their review in branch protection. Review a change that sets a rule to
off or lower, adds to `indirectPins`, adds an exclude pattern or raises `failOn` like a change to code: each of them can
hide a gap.

## SSDF

The repository is checked against NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF) in its own pipeline and before every release, with
`ssdf-repo-check` pinned to its release commit. The evidence it looks for is in these files:

| Practice | Evidence in this repository |
| --- | --- |
| PO.1 Define security requirements | CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/secure-defaults.md |
| PO.2 Roles and responsibilities | .github/CODEOWNERS |
| PO.3 Toolchain | .github/workflows/ci.yml, codeql.yml, release.yml |
| PO.4 Criteria for security checks | CodeQL with the security-extended queries, the SSDF gate in ci.yml and release.yml |
| PO.5 Secure environments | a `permissions:` block in every workflow, actions pinned to commits |
| PS.1 Protect the code | .gitignore for keys and `.env`, `npm run check` for committed secrets |
| PS.2 Integrity of releases | SHA-256 checksums and a build provenance attestation in release.yml |
| PS.3 Archive and provenance | a CycloneDX SBOM and the CHANGELOG with every release |
| PW.1 Design for security | docs/threat-model.md |
| PW.2 Review the design | docs/decisions |
| PW.4 Reuse secure components | no runtime dependencies, a lock file, Dependabot |
| PW.5 Secure coding | CONTRIBUTING.md, `npm run check` |
| PW.6 Build settings | `npm ci` from the lock file |
| PW.7 Code review | the pull request template and CODEOWNERS |
| PW.8 Testing | `npm test` on Linux, Windows and macOS with Node 22 and 24, `npm run test:coverage`, hostile input tests |
| PW.9 Secure defaults | this document |
| RV.1 Find vulnerabilities | SECURITY.md, Dependabot |
